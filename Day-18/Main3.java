// Abstract classes
//1. Cannot be instantiated directly
//2. Can contain abstract method (method without implementations)
//3. Can also contain normal methods.
//4. Is meant to be extended.

//. Questions:
//1. Can abstract classes have constructors?  --> Yes
//2. Can abstract classes be final ? --> No
//3. Can abstract class have static methods/variables ? --> Yes
//4. Can abstract classes private methods ? --> yes but non abstract
//5. Can abstract classes have final methods ? --> yes but non abstract
//6. Can abstract classes have no abstract method ? --> Yes
